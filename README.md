**NeuralBlitz is a new paradigm for AI built on coherence, transparency, and trust. It is a "glass box" symbiotic intelligence, designed to augment human creativity and reasoning.**

Unlike traditional "black box" models, NeuralBlitz is architected from the ground up to be explainable, auditable, and aligned with core ethical principles. Every output is the result of a verifiable logical path, cryptographically sealed to ensure trust.

### Core Principles

*   **Coherence by Design:** The system follows purposeful reasoning, not just pattern association.
*   **Radical Transparency:** Every decision can be traced back to its origin.
*   **Ethical Governance:** An immutable `CharterLayer` provides hardwired ethical guardrails.
*   **Symbiotic Partnership:** Designed to amplify human potential, not replace it.
