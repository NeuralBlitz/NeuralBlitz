"""
Core implementation of the Dynamic Representational Substrate (DRS) Engine.

The DRS is the memory and knowledge manifold of NeuralBlitz. It stores concepts,
facts, and, most importantly, the weighted relationships between them. It provides
the context and raw material upon which the Universal Neural Engine (UNE)
directs its focus.
