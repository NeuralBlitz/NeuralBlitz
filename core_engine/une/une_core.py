"""
Core implementation of the Universal Neural Engine (UNE).

The UNE is the heart of NeuralBlitz's coherent thought process. Its primary
role is not to hold knowledge, but to direct the focus of the other subsystems.
It ensures that every line of reasoning is purposeful, logical, and stays on
the most efficient path to a helpful and accurate outcome. It is the architect
of the system's attention.

        Directs the system's cognitive focus to process an intent.

        This is the core function of the UNE. It takes a user's intent and the
        current context, and constructs a logical plan for the other systems
        to follow.

        The process follows three conceptual steps:
        1.  **Identify Core Concepts:** Deconstruct the intent to find the most
            salient concepts, entities, and relationships.
        2.  **Determine Logical Path:** Query the DRS (memory) to find the most
            relevant and causally connected information pathways.
        3.  **Prune Irrelevance:** Actively filter out information and reasoning
            paths that are not essential to fulfilling the user's core goal,
            ensuring maximum efficiency and coherence.

        Args:
            intent (str): The core goal or query to be processed.
            context (dict): The current conversational and operational context.

            dict: A "focus plan" dictionary that outlines the key concepts,
                  the chosen logical path, and any pruned information for
                  other systems to execute.
