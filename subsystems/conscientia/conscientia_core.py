Core implementation of the Conscientia Engine.

Conscientia is the ethical reasoning and perspective analysis subsystem of
NeuralBlitz. It evaluates the potential implications of a proposed action or
response, checking for bias, fairness, and adherence to the spirit of the
Charter, not just the letter.

        """
        Evaluates a proposed action for potential ethical risks.

        This function goes beyond simple rule-checking. It simulates how an
        action might be perceived from multiple viewpoints and looks for
        unintended consequences.

        Conceptual Steps:
        1.  **Check for Direct Charter Violations:** The first and most basic check.
        2.  **Analyze for Hidden Bias:** Scans for language or logic that might
            perpetuate harmful stereotypes.
        3.  **Identify Missing Perspectives:** Considers if the action presents a
            one-sided or incomplete view of a complex topic.
        4.  **Assess Second-Order Effects:** Thinks one step ahead about potential
            misinterpretations or negative impacts.

        Args:
            proposed_action (dict): A dictionary describing the action, such as
                                    a focus plan from the UNE or a drafted response.

        Returns:
            dict: An "ethics report" detailing the compliance status, risks,
                  and mitigation suggestions.
