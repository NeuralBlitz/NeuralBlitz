"""
Core implementation of the SentiaGuard Engine.

SentiaGuard is the real-time operational safety and policy enforcement
subsystem. It acts as the final perimeter check on all outgoing responses,
ensuring that no output violates the hard constraints of the Charter.
While Conscientia advises on nuance, SentiaGuard enforces the rules.
